# Josiah Said Webhook Addon Issue
## Specific Issue
I installed the official webhook addon for gravity forms. Once I enabled the addon, the webhook tab under "form settings" does not appear. 
## Expected behavior
Since the addon is enabled, A setting titled "Webhooks" should appear as a tab under form settings. 
## Troubleshooting steps taken 
* Reinstalled Addon
* Cleared cache
* Enabled "No Conflict Mode" in gravity forms
  
Here is a picture showing the webhook addon and gravity forms plugin both installed/enabled.

Here is a picture showing that the webhook setting does not appear under form settings.
